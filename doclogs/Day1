System Admin Command
> kill
    - Sends a signal to a process, usually related to stopping the process. All signals except for SIGKILL and SIGSTOP can be intercepted by the process to perform a clean exit.
    - kill {processID}
    - Signal the operating system to immediately terminate a program:
        kill -9|KILL {processID}
    - Signal the operating system to pause a program until a SIGCONT ("continue") signal is received:
        kill -17|STOP {processID}

> killall
    - Sends kill signal to all the instance of the process by name: killall {processName}
    - Ask before process termination: killall --interactive {processName}
    - Force kill a process: killall KILL {processName}

> pkill
    - Kill all process that match the process name: pkill "{processName}"
    - Force kill all matching processes: pkill -9 "{processName}"

Linux File Security
> Linux File OwnerShip
    - File Ownership can be explored using ls -l command
    ~/foo$ ls -l bar
    -rw-r--r-- 1 zoo zoo 75 Nov  4 11:53 bar

Linux Permission
> chmod
    - Change permission for a file/directory
    - chmod {who}{operator}{permission} fileName/directoryName
    Who: u (user/owner), g (group), o (others), a (all).
    Operator: + (add), - (remove), = (set exact).
    Permission: r (read), w (write), x (execute

Linux Advance Permission
    - Additional three different permissions: SUID, SGID, The Sticky Bit
> SUID
    - If SUID bit is set, then the file will be executed with the privilages of the owner
    - Only owner of the file or root user can set SUID to 1
    - SUID can be set using the u+s command: chmod u+s fileName
        eg:
        ~ $ ls -l per
        -rw-r--r-- 1 gafoli gafoli 21 Nov  5 10:14 per

        ~ $ chmod u+s per

        ~ $ ls -l per
        -rwSr--r-- 1 gafoli gafoli 21 Nov  5 10:14 per
    - Can remove SUID using the u-s command: chmod u-s fileName
        eg:
        ~ $ ls -l per
        -rwSr--r-- 1 gafoli gafoli 21 Nov  5 10:14 per

        ~ $ chmod u-s per

        ~ $ ls -l per
        -rw-r--r-- 1 gafoli gafoli 21 Nov  5 10:14 per

> SGID
    - Set-Group-ID
    - Similar to SUID except that, an executable runs with the privileges of the group
    - You can set SGID bit by passing g+s to the: chmod g+s fileName
    - Can remove SGID using the g-s command: chmod g-s fileName

> The Sticky Bit
    - If Sticky Bit is set on a directory, only the user of file/dir, root user can delete the file
    - Used to delete other users files inside a shared memory
    - Can be set using command: chmod +t dirName
